## Overview
The instant ngp in pure JAX still needs optimization. Currently, it is way slower than the CUDA version. 


## Prerequisites
 - Set up a virtual Python3 environment, then install necessary packages with this command
   ```Shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
 - Or, just open Google Colab and run **notebook_train.ipynb**
